# Cert Generator
I made this to an alternative to openSSL & its forks.
That's because openSSL & its forks, (exmple: libreSSL) are pure shit when it comes to cert generation.
You need to put a file in `C:\Windows\Piss` or something like, and you must wear clown shoes and refer to yourself as mary?
It's all over the place, and there is no proper documentation.
It's pure shit, who ever come up with that idea is clearly an idiot.
GNU-TLS is better than OpenSSL, but this is java so it's even better.

Anyway, this small app makes it very simple to generate a certificate.


# How to use
Configure the cert you want to generate in the properties file then run the app. You'll have to compile it yourself.
I have mine compiled to an exe because I'm fancy.
Anyway, example configuration files are included.


# Requirements
JDK-24
